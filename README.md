Go to the [layouts branch](https://github.com/keynergy/layouts/tree/layouts).

## Contributing 
- If you're adding a new layout, duplicate an existing one to use as reference.
- If there is no website for the layout, or you don't know it, you can either set `link = ""` or just get rid of the whole line. If the layout has a website, but it isn't listed, please add it!
- If you don't know what year the layout was released, just set it to 0. If you *do* know the release year, but it's not there, please add it! 
- Keep `map` as `{}`, it won't work without this.
- If the layout has more than three rows, set `home_row` to the index where the home row is, starting at 0.
- If the layout has a thumb row, set `thumb_row` to the index where the thumb row is, starting at 0.
